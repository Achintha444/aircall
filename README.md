# üìû Aircall ‚Äì Hiring Assignment

This is a simplified version of the Aircall app UI, built as part of a hiring assignment. It shows call activities, allows archiving/unarchiving calls, and uses a clean UI built with React, Vite, and Material UI.

## üîß What I Changed

The original project was built using **React 16** and **Create React App**. I migrated it to a modern setup with the following improvements:

- Switched from **CRA to Vite** for faster builds and better DX
- Upgraded **React 16 ‚Üí React 19**
- Replaced inline and basic styles with **Material UI v7**
- Added a **custom theme system** with scalable color tokens
- Refactored the component structure for better readability and reusability
- Set up **GitHub Actions** to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages on push to `master`


## üîç Features

- View all call activities (active and archived)
- Archive or unarchive individual calls
- Archive all with one click
- Responsive layout
- Clean UI with custom MUI theme
- Fast build with Vite
